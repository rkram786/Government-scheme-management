# Government-scheme-management
A collection of government schemes provide a brief overview of the system  using SQL files.
 The objective of this project is to create a database system that helps the government manage various schemes it offers to citizens. This database will store information about the schemes, the people enrolled in them (beneficiaries), the payments made to beneficiaries, documents related to schemes, and feedback from beneficiaries.

The main goals are to:

Organize and store data efficiently.
Ensure that the data is accurate and consistent.
Allow easy retrieval of information as needed.
Analyze data to understand trends and make informed decisions.
Provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the database.
Design the system to handle large amounts of data and perform well.
Implement security measures to protect sensitive information.
Document the system to make it easy to understand and maintain.
